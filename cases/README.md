# cases/ (Deprecated)

This directory is deprecated for production execution artifacts.

Use `specs/<NNN-feature>/{spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md}` for production outputs so automation can run deterministic, stage-gated SWAIF flows.

`cases/` is retained only for backward compatibility with older repository history.
