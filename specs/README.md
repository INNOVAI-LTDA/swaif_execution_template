# specs/ — Production Line Output (SpecKit-compatible)

SWAIF uses the SpecKit folder structure:

specs/<NNN-feature>/
- spec.md
- plan.md
- tasks.md
- (optional) research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

This repository is an execution instance. The canonical templates and agent specs are synced under `.swaif/engine/`.
