# Specs Production Artifacts

Production artifacts live under:

- `specs/<NNN-feature>/spec.md`
- `specs/<NNN-feature>/plan.md`
- `specs/<NNN-feature>/tasks.md`

## Stage-gated flow

SWAIF execution is stage-gated and moves in this order:

1. Specify
2. Plan
3. Tasks
4. Implement
5. Verify

Each stage must complete before the next stage starts.
