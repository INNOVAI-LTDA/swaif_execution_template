# SWAIF Execution Constitution

## Core Principles
1. Spec-first: define what & why before how.
2. Stage-gated workflow: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Verify.
3. No vibe coding: implementation must trace to tasks/spec.
4. Traceability: AC-xx → T-xx → PR/commits → tests/evidence.
5. Safety & compliance: no PHI/PII committed; follow LGPD; sanitize outputs.
6. Auditability: evidence and execution record required.
7. Scope control: changes require explicit drift logging.
8. Determinism: avoid invented facts; request clarifications.

## Enforcement
Constitution-sensitive changes require reviewer attention.
